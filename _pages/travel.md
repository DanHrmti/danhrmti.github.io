I am passionate about traveling and widening my perspective of the world by meeting people, learning about different cultures and experiencing nature.

In the summer of 2015 I began backpacking in East Asia, traveling in Mongolia, China, Nepal and Southeast Asia for about a year.
During that time, I volunteered with the NGO ["All Hands and Hearts"](https://www.allhandsandhearts.org/) (AHAH) in disaster relief efforts after typhoon Yolanda in The Philippines and in earthquake struck Nepal.

In the following summer I traveled to Europe where I worked in various vegetable and dairy farms in France and Switzerland while solidifying my high-school French.
I then spent a winter season working and snowboarding in Colorado. From there I journeyed to Quebec, Canada, where I continued working in farms and learning French.

From Canada I flew to Peru where I traveled and volunteered in another AHAH project aiding coastal towns affected by severe mudslides before finally returning home to begin my B.Sc. at the Technion.

Since then, I have made an effort to interleave traveling with my studies and hope to continue doing so in the future.
