I am an M.Sc. student at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology advised by Prof. [Aviv Tamar](https://avivt.github.io/avivt/).
I am interested in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and related representation learning research towards building general and adaptive decision-making agents.

Research questions I am currently drawn to involve how to incorporate *structure* in learning algorithms that facilitates sample efficient learning and generalization.
Recently I have been studying object-centric structure in RL for generalization in multi-object robotic manipulation.

I completed my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and Physics at the Technion supported by the Alfred and Anna Grey Excellence Scholarship.

Before beginning my academic journey, I spent two defining years traveling in East Asia, Europe and America. You can find more details about this in the [Travel](https://danhrmti.github.io//travel/) section.
